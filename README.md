Virtual Assistant for Voice Commands
Our virtual assistant can perform various searches on Google using your voice commands. This feature leverages speech recognition to interpret user commands and executes the corresponding searches, enhancing hands-free interaction and accessibility.

Volume Control
The volume_control.py script allows users to control the system volume by measuring the distance between the thumb and index finger. The script uses the pycaw library for volume control and cv2 for computer vision, offering an intuitive way to adjust volume levels without physical contact.

Mouse Control
The mouse_control.py script enables users to move the mouse cursor and perform clicks using hand gestures. It uses the pyautogui library for mouse control and cv2 for hand detection, providing a touchless method to navigate and interact with the computer.

Screen Brightness Control
The screen_brightness_control.py script allows users to adjust the screen brightness by detecting the distance between the thumb and middle finger. It uses the wmi library for brightness control and cv2 for hand tracking, facilitating easy adjustment of screen brightness to suit different lighting conditions.

Screenshot Capture
The screenshot_capture.py script captures screenshots based on specific hand gestures. It uses the pyautogui library for capturing screenshots and cv2 for detecting hand gestures, enabling users to quickly capture and save screenshots without using keyboard shortcuts.

Video Forward/Rewind Control
The video_control.py script allows users to control video playback, including forwarding and rewinding, using hand gestures. This feature provides a convenient way to navigate through video content without relying on traditional input methods.
